        <h2><a href=assets/memo-example>SB 202 and Voting Legislation</a></h2>
        <p>The goal of this memo is to analyze the different frames surrounding voting legislation in Georiga with SB 202. In 2021 this lengthy bill reformed the way that voting works in the state after claims of fraud led by President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The frames fall on party lines with liberal sources declaring this an attack on democracy and the civil rights of minority groups while conservative sources say the bill will protect against voter fraud and increase trust in the electoral system.</p>
