      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic, political, and defense organizations.</p>
        <p>European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945.</p>
        <p>With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany <abbr>(FRG)</abbr> and the eastern German Democratic Republic <abbr>(GDR)</abbr>. The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations, while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The end of the Cold War allowed for German reunification in 1990.</p>
        <p> Since then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999, Germany and 10 other <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries introduced a common European exchange currency, the euro. </p>
